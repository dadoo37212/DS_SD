The SD set named ÔDS2Õ has 2,420 cases with a ICD9 code of 758.0. All subsequent retrievals from SD use the cases in the ÔDS2Õ dataset.The SD Set Tools tab allows exportation of ICD code, CPT codes, labs and vital signs. Each export dataset is limited to 10,000 records. ICD, CPT and Lab codes require manually selecting specific values.  Vital signs have checkboxes and multiple may be selected at once.Labs records have Date, Time, Short Name, Long Name, Value, Abnormal, Age at eventCPT Code records have Date, Code, Description, age at eventICD Code records have Date, Code, Description, age at eventVital Signs Ð Date, Time, Value, Age at event	BP; BMI; Height; Weight; Resp RateSince the SD Set tool does not allow exporting Medications or Documents, four javascript functions were added to the Firefox browser to extract information from these sources. The javascripts functions GetMeds, Copy! And GetDocs and CopyDocs! Were used retrieve information from a displayed case and saves the information to the clipboard.  A support Ruby program was then used to save the data in the clipboard to a file.  The file name includes the unique studyid from the case retrieved. Thus, there is one file per case per data type.Medications summary Ð Drug Name, Mentions, First Mention Date, Last Mention 	Requires GetMeds and Copy!

Since birth year is not a variable available for selection of cases and each export may have no more than 10,000 records, retrieval of information for the Control group could not be accomplished using a single dataset like the DS2 dataset for DS cases. Five datasets were defined based on gender and age.  The final age ranges include was accomplished through trial and error.  Various potential age values were tried.  The final export datasets had the number of records closest to but not more than 10,000.Table 1.
